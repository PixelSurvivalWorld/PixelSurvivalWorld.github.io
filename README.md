## üåü Overview

MEMEFI represents the perfect fusion of Meme culture and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), designed to revitalize the cryptocurrency market through a powerful economic model, high community consensus, and innovative token mechanisms.

Our motto: **"Sellers regret, holders earn dividends."** MEMEFI transcends the typical Meme coin project, establishing itself as a holder-centric ecosystem that drives value growth through dynamic taxation and follow-up mechanisms.
